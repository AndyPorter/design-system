    <p class="govuk-lead">This is about what I/we've been up to with the design system this week. This is a lightweight form of communication about the project - what's been done, been thought about, learnt.  What's new and what changed, for people wanting to design services, is in the <a href="/advice">advice</a> and <a href="/history">history</a> pages.</p> 

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Weeknotes</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-09-oct-2020">09 October 2020</h3>

    <p>
    	week plan:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>publish survey results - done</li>
	  		<li>publish footer and links</li>
	  		<li>publish advice creation and review process</li>
	  		<li>make a better homepage - show whats new, evolution - publish the above</li>
	  		<li>new survey / copy existing? - for anyone who visits the site, to have a go with - e.g. front end, product</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>Done: 
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>survey results published (survey closed, and results shared on design slack channel) - not analysed results, no comments on slack about it</li>
	  		<li>v2 survey made, a copy of the previous, but open to everyone, so additional question about what your role/job is.  Not been sent to anyone - consider when to do that, but readied it in case we got interest form non designers by talking about previous survey, and...</li>
	  		<li>new homepage - make 'a launchable thing' - mvp design system.  may rasie interest/questions outside of design, so survey ready for that.</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">a launchable thing...</h4>
	  <p>Sketched out idea for homepage, what that meant - what would be an MVP that would last in basic format for a while.</p>
	  <p>Key things to answer i thought were: 
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>what is the design system then? - what is this now, some context</li>
	  		<li>provide some value - why do i want to use this? - advice to follow</li>
	  		<li>we hope this is a dynamic thing and will grow, as this is the start</li>
	  		<li>its a whole practice thing (actually a cross practice - but start with the practice)</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>Given all this - what seemed useful was a pattern we can reuse for a while: whats new, whats in progress, help we need - form the homepage, and then a page for each, which can be built outward as necessary - e.g. whats new can start to build into a history, so can see what was done when as we don;t know how long between visits.  Also gives a transparent way of people seeing the progress we (the practice) are making.  Whats new and whats in progress also need full practice engagement, and interest so focus them toward others getting involved - feeding back after release, and helping stuff get agreed</p>
	  <p>We didn't get footer, links and process drafts reviewed and agreed between Laura and myself.  too much else on - higher priority (people, and teams delivery first) - helping with staff progression, Laura's BEIS assessment work, and mainly with FutureGov starters.  Optimistically this will happen next week - but leave, and UCD Gathering is 4 days of next week.  So likely wont be done - just first pass review.</p>
	  <p>FutureGov design colleagues - lots of interesting questions about design documentation, and how we work, etc. They will have interesting perspectives and knowledge and experience about design systems, and topics that relate, so organised a chat with Stuart for next week, and shared the current design system with him and some notes.  He worked on design system previously - so a lot there he can help us with.</p>
	  <p>Pleased with where this now is at - feels like a launch-able thing.  Felt it was small audience MVP before, but i think the homepage and basic 4 pages are a good basic structure that makes it feel more real to people who see it, especially outside the practice.  People's first impression, reflects on whether they follow the advice - we want design work to be taken seriously. Feels like a thing - before was a couple of white pages, no different to a document. And is similar in look to gov design systems.</p>
	  <p>I'm close to it - the acid test is the audience - designers, need to see it, feel it, consider it, and feedback.  Would like that to happen next week.</p>

    	week plan:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>write shorter/briefer weeknotes &#128512;</li>
	  		<li>write plan here at start of week</li>
	  		<li>create, agree and publish our first advice - links opening in new windows or not.  Prompted by -> this convo came up again on the accessibility slack channel.  The question was from a non-designer and people want 'rules'/advice to follow.  Although we had a 'decision'/advice a while ago - ts not public.  Slack convo then had lots of opinions and differing advcie. single source of practice guidance is good for everyone.</li>
	  		<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8SfRY5NJF5DK7HVYU96Dfc565avCsuj35JLP8gMKZEgbHg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Survey</a> - remind / encourage people, get feedback about it (email and at Thu community session)</li>
	  		<li>make a better homepage - make it a place we can share/is useful</li>
	  		<li>homepage to have links to a few high level sections?  if so and one it prototyping, include link to community tools like form validating in proto</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>'opening accessibility statement links in a new window, or not' came up again on the accessibility slack channel.  The question was from a non-designer and people want 'rules'/advice to follow.  Although we had a 'decision'/gave advice a while ago - it's not public.  Slack convo had lots of opinions and differing advice. A single source of practice guidance is good for everyone.  I drafted some advice - about links in general, and specifcally about when to open in a new tab or not, and sent to Laura Joe and Erin for review.</p>
	  <p>Joe i don't think had time to look, and Erin fedback she's too busy with project work to contribute as much as she'd want.  I thought this might well be the case, so good to learn, and highlights that we will find it hard to make it a practice thing, for people to find time, and specifically to draft good content.</p>
	  <p>Laura and i decided it would be better to also publish advice about the footer, and then publish both and cross reference.  After coming up with footer design, Laura fedback that she needed more context - as i alone am looking at the detail and the background, it's hard for others to see/know all that.  Again good to learn, and with me being full time on it, but no one else having much time, i need to summarise the work and present it for review.</p>
	  <p>I summarised all the footers in use in staff systemsm the old design system, and gov.uk design system - they are all different.  I summarising the differences, the issues, and proposed a design very simlar to the gov design system.  I think a document summarising what we know, and a conclusion and design specification are a useful document to have - a) for others to review so we can determine the practices v1 of advice, but also b) we get a history, documentation of our decisions, what we knew and why we made the decision we publish.</p>
	  <p>Given other peoples availabilty, and the desire for this to be a practice wide agreement, and buy-in, Laura and I also came up with a, v1, process for drafting and publishing advice.</p>
	  <p>So, we didn't get the footer and links advice published, but have worked out a process for doing so, which feels very useful.</p>
	  <p>like everything, the process should be public, v1, and commentable - I'll publish it here next week, once written up - it will be a google doc, like all our documentation.</p>

	  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-25-sep-2020">25 September 2020</h3>
    <p>
    	So we (Joe, Laura, Erin and Andy [I] had a meet) - to discuss questions, and get thinking going, about:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>why are we doing this? what outcomes are we looking for?</li>
	  		<li>has someone asked for this/what is 'this'?</li>
	  		<li>what do designers need?</li>
	  		<li>is the outcome/need the same for everyone - at a high level (better services made more quickly).  So what do we do for designers (remembering that more than just designers 'design' the services)
	  		<li>what shape is the system - what do we mean by a design system?</li>
	  		<li>we have 3 different brands / service channels - one singular thing, or a collection of similar things - like one per discrete 'family'</li>
	  		<li>what constitutes 'proven' - is public advice, and whats the stuff/work below that threshold - the body of the iceberg below the waterline of public</li>
	  		<li>how do we get there - its a lot of work - one person/team or part of everyones job - how do we do that. Other depts/orgs are bigger and have teams</li>
	  		<li>where I think we are at - what I think we should do next - common things in every page / service</li>
	  		<li>what do we do next - lets do something tangible, start publishing stuff people need - what is that? can we decide today?</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>We've discovered that a design system is part of the DDaT Business plan &#128547;, Joe is going to find out more about what that means, what peoples thinking is/was, what objectives, outcomes.  Give us more context.  But we should concentrate on a library of things for designers - (people whose job title is designer), and we should find out what they need - answer the question - what do designers need from a design system</p>
	  <p>The trick is to not ask that directly - we know this from user research - it's such a loaded question, and heavily biased toward a whole raft of things.  So needs thought - draft some thoughts on this, involve a researcher for advice.  Maybe its ok to ask directly and know we have bias - just get things rolling, as we can measure, and change direction - as people give it more thought.</p>
	  <p>I'd really like the use this as part of the 'pull' on the design system - the practitioners to say what they next need - so we focus on meeting what they want - so would like to make it easy to achieve, and make the results public - lets the practice itself own the backlog.  (note: add this to design system principles - that is is owned/led by the practice &#128512;).  I think this might be a case of - don't over think it - be agile, make a small thing, dont be precious about it, measure it, respond to whats learnt, change tack, or dispose.</p>
	  <p>maybe a survey - much as i despise surveys, but knowing their limitations will mean we'll not be wedded to it.  Could ask about current use of things in popular design systems, and get an indiaction of usefulness of each - easy to automatically collated and publish results, and run again later. <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8SfRY5NJF5DK7HVYU96Dfc565avCsuj35JLP8gMKZEgbHg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Survey</a> created and sent out</b> (Ros tested),  We'll publish the results here</p>
	  </p>
	  <p>Added versioning, wrote some routes to hopefully, always point people to the latest advice.  Like anything we make - we want to be able to see/show how weve changed it over time.  History and Weeknotes dont get versioned - thet are the ongoing documentation of the thing.  so /advice alwats goes to latest advice, /weeknotes and /history to, well obvs.</p>
	  <p>Id like to change the main page to a landing page, and have a whats new - maybe next week, with the survey results &#128512;</p> 

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-18-sep-2020">18 September 2020</h3>
    <p>
    	all the shared documents of 'what is currently in use' - have been updated to include everyones notes (so we have no orphan documents) for the published:
 			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>components</li>
	  		<li>pages</li>
	  		<li>style</li>
	  		<li>help pattern</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The tracking spreadsheet reflects where we are with these documents, and the individual document history is also up to date - so our three things (site, shared docs and tracker) are all up to date, tidied up and consistent - we are at a good known point.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The question is what to do next.  So have summarised where we are, how we got here, and given some though to what shall we do next then - lets work out whats next in the context of the big picture. Organised discussion for next week.
	  </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-11-sep-2020">11 September 2020</h3>
    <p>
    	I would like the way we work to be an exemplar of working in an agile way - be open, clear, communicate regularly, not be too stiff, just enough, etc, so have:
 			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>started a <a href="https://trello.com/b/8oDGtPah/design-system">kanban board</a> for the next phase - a backlog of big things, that will feed the 'to-do now' list. Just me, Joe, Laura and Erin to start</li>
	  		<li>added a <a href="history">history page</a>.  Good to show people that content is being added/improved (governance / demonstrate value), But more so to help design system users to find out 'whats new since i last came here?'  The GOV design system - i find i don't know when advice gets updated, or new advice is added. I think that's a useful thing to provded a user. As this feels like it would be useful functionality -  its something to test (note to self - add to trello cards for user need and + assumption/to test &#128512;)</li>
	  		<li>started these 'project weeknotes' - good to a) reflect on what done/learnt and b) communicate progress in a simple, lightweight way</li>
	  		<li>orgainsed a meet for next week to decide shape of next phase of work, and make a backlog</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>The advice published - the 'what do we currently have' - is being updated daily as I've been improving the collated documents, to ensure they are a single way to see what we have documented about each thing.</p>
	  <p>This housekeeping also includes the google sheet, so everything is tidy enough to be useful and less a source of confusion.  This led me to think more about the purpose of the different things we have, and tweak things:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			  <li>website - the front door - the place to go to for design advice and everything about the design system (and the project work - hence this page)</li>
			  <li>collated documents - where what we know about each component/pattern is collated.  These are essentially the 'pages' of what we currently do, that are published here.  So needed to make each one 'the thing', by ensuring no orphan documents exist and that its all joined up.  These documents are the public advice, and can have comments, discussion, opinion - they are what we know and think.  Google docs are great to comment, track changes, collaborate etc - everyone can use with no technical training needed (unlike github).  So an important principle/need (note to self - add to my list &#128512;&#128512;) - minimise the barrier to entry/collaboration</li>
			  <li>Google sheet - use to track progress and see status - a view across the documentation - for example: whos working on documents, has it been reviewed.  The sheet contains more than this, like proposed patterns / ideas for patterns - they would be better surfaced on the site, with a mechanism for feedback and new patterns spotted (&#128513; another note to self)
		  	</li>
	  	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>wow, writing this weeknote is useful - made me think, and i added 4 useful items to the backlog/what we know - user needs, principles, something to test/learn more about, how we organise the work so its easier to do &#128541;</p>
