		<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Introducing the Design system</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body-l">We are working towards a Design System for HM Land Registry digital teams - as most people will imagine it - a visible library of designs and guidance.</p>

    <p>This is the start of publishing a body of reviewed, agreed and evidenced advice and patterns.  The <a href="previous-introduction">previous introduction (not widely shared) outlines where we were at in August</a></p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Knowing what's what</h3>
    <p>The site will be the only link you need to find things out: the latest advice to follow, how to contribute, whats going on with the design system and whats already happenned.  <b>Work in the open.</b></p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Helping out</h3>
    <p>The system will be most successful if it's a whole (and cross) practice thing.  There is no master blueprint of what that this all looks like, which we are implementing piecemeal.  This is an agile, iterative, approach toward some desired outcomes and goals, using principles like continuous feedback.</p>
    <p>Get involved or give feedback at any time, on anything (email to Andy and Laura).  We'll highlight in this system and advice docuentation where specific help is needed from people.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Hierarchy of advice</h2>
    <p>The <a href="advice">hierarchy of advice to follow when creating new services, products or systems</a>, for GOV.UK services, professional users and staff.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Survey results</h2>
    <p>Survey, before we'd published anything, to ask try to find out what designers need from a design system.  Designers are the primary users, and ones we want to start with.</p>
    <p>Design system - What do you need:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    	<li>anonymous survey, gathered ten responses</li>
    	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8SfRY5NJF5DK7HVYU96Dfc565avCsuj35JLP8gMKZEgbHg/viewanalytics">results</a></li>
    	<li>no analysis on results performed yet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Drafted version 2 of the survey - for the next most likely groups of users of a design system - front end devs, user reserachers, product people, testers.  If you are a designer that missed the first survey - you can take this one - help test it - ping Andy P</p>

<!--  
    <p><b>Feedback to</b>: Andy Porter and Laura Clifford, by email.  Also in the documentation as explained there.</p> -->
