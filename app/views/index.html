    </h1>    

    <p>We are working towards a Design System for HM Land Registry digital teams - as most people will imagine it - a visible library of designs and guidance. Which is the tip of an iceberg</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"><a href="advice">Advice to follow for all new work</a></h2>
    <p>This is a hierarchy of advice to follow when creating new services, products or systems, for GOV.UK services, professional users and staff</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Contributing to the advice</h3>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who provided their work and thoughts so far.  Next, we need this to become a whole practice (and cross practice) thing.</p>
  	<p>All feedback - about anything, anytime, is welcome.  During this next phase we will also become more explicit in seeking feedback about what you need from a Design System, and if it's working</p>
    <p><b>Feedback to</b>: Andy Porter and Laura Clifford, by email.  Also in the documentation as explained there.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What's coming next</h2>
    <p>Our Design System will be a place for reusable things - like components, patterns - and advice - that are 'proven to work', so they can be used to create, at greater speed, high quality work that solves problems for users and the organisation.</p>

    <p>We've been in a phase of collecting the work done in teams - the designs in use, the thinking beneath, and how well we know if they work.  Creating a more 'familiar' looking design system will occur in this next phase, as we refine what we have collected.</p>

    <p>The high level plan is, incrementally and iteratively:

	    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li><b>publish advice as soon as it's good enough</b></li>
	  		<li><b>work on the next most important items that people need</b></li>
	  		<li><b>repeat</b></li>
	  	</ul>

    </p> 
    <p>Detail of the next phase is being worked, will be published here, and will also show:
    	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>how we decide what constitutes 'proven' - what is 'good enough'?</li>
	  		<li>where do we publish information and assets - where people will consume it most easily</li>
	  		<li>how do we turn this into a living thing, that many practices contribute to and use?</li>
	  	</ul>
   	</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What have we learnt so far
    <span class="govuk-caption-l">that indicates what the Design System could be as it matures</span></h2>
    <p>More detail to add about what we learnt in this 'what do we have now', collection phase</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What did we do before this?</h3>
    <p>We explored ideas of <a href="alpha-ds">what a useful Design System for HM Land Registry could be - what it might contain</a>, how might people reuse the information, and how we might build and maintain it.</p>

    <p>More detail to add here about what we learnt form that</p>
