    <p class="govuk-lead">This is about what I/we've been up to with the design system this week. This is a lightweight form of communication about the project - what's been done, been thought about, learnt.  What's new and what changed, for people wanting to design services, is in the <a href="advice">advice</a> and <a href="history">history</a> pages.</p>

    <p>
    	So we (Joe, Laura, Erin and Andy [I] had a meet) - to discuss questions, and get thinking going, about:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>why are we doing this? what outcomes are we looking for?</li>
	  		<li>has someone asked for this/what is 'this'?</li>
	  		<li>what do designers need?</li>
	  		<li>is the outcome/need the same for everyone - at a high level (better services made more quickly).  So what do we do for designers (remembering that more than just designers 'design' the services)
	  		<li>what shape is the system - what do we mean by a design system?</li>
	  		<li>we have 3 different brands / service channels - one singular thing, or a collection of similar things - like one per discrete 'family'</li>
	  		<li>what constitutes 'proven' - is public advice, and whats the stuff/work below that threshold - the body of the iceberg below the waterline of public</li>
	  		<li>how do we get there - its a lot of work - one person/team or part of everyones job - how do we do that. Other depts/orgs are bigger and have teams</li>
	  		<li>where I think we are at - what I think we should do next - common things in every page / service</li>
	  		<li>what do we do next - lets do something tangible, start publishing stuff people need - what is that? can we decide today?</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>We've discovered that a design system is part of the DDaT Business plan &#128547;, Joe is going to find out more about what that means, what peoples thinking is/was, what objectives, outcomes.  Give us more context.  But we should concentrate on a library of things for designers - (people whose job title is designer), and we should find out what they need - answer the question - what do designers need from a design system</p>
	  <p>The trick is to not ask that directly - we know this from user research - it's such a loaded question, and heavily biased toward a whole raft of things.  So needs thought - draft some thoughts on this, involve a researcher for advice.  Maybe its ok to ask directly and know we have bias - just get things rolling, as we can measure, and change direction - as people give it more thought.</p>
	  <p>I'd really like the use this as part of the 'pull' on the design system - the practitioners to say what they next need - so we focus on meeting what they want - so would like to make it easy to achieve, and make the results public - lets the practice itself own the backlog.  (note: add this to design system principles - that is is owned/led by the practice &#128512;).  I think this might be a case of - don't over think it - be agile, make a small thing, dont be precious about it, measure it, respond to whats learnt, change tack, or dispose.</p>
	  <p>maybe a survey - much as i despise surveys, but knowing their limitations will mean we'll not be wedded to it.  Could ask about current use of things in popular design systems, and get an indiaction of usefulness of each - easy to automatically collated and publish results, and run again later.</p>
	  </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-18-sep-2020">18 September 2020</h3>
    <p>
    	all the shared documents of 'what is currently in use' - have been updated to include everyones notes (so we have no orphan documents) for the published:
 			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>components</li>
	  		<li>pages</li>
	  		<li>style</li>
	  		<li>help pattern</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The tracking spreadsheet reflects where we are with these documents, and the individual document history is also up to date - so our three things (site, shared docs and tracker) are all up to date, tidied up and consistent - we are at a good known point.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The question is what to do next.  So have summarised where we are, how we got here, and given some though to what shall we do next then - lets work out whats next in the context of the big picture. Organised discussion for next week.
	  </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="weeknotes-11-sep-2020">11 September 2020</h3>
    <p>
    	I would like the way we work to be an exemplar of working in an agile way - be open, clear, communicate regularly, not be too stiff, just enough, etc, so have:
 			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	  		<li>started a <a href="https://trello.com/b/8oDGtPah/design-system">kanban board</a> for the next phase - a backlog of big things, that will feed the 'to-do now' list. Just me, Joe, Laura and Erin to start</li>
	  		<li>added a <a href="history">history page</a>.  Good to show people that content is being added/improved (governance / demonstrate value), But more so to help design system users to find out 'whats new since i last came here?'  The GOV design system - i find i don't know when advice gets updated, or new advice is added. I think that's a useful thing to provded a user. As this feels like it would be useful functionality -  its something to test (note to self - add to trello cards for user need and + assumption/to test &#128512;)</li>
	  		<li>started these 'project weeknotes' - good to a) reflect on what done/learnt and b) communicate progress in a simple, lightweight way</li>
	  		<li>orgainsed a meet for next week to decide shape of next phase of work, and make a backlog</li>
	  	</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>The advice published - the 'what do we currently have' - is being updated daily as I've been improving the collated documents, to ensure they are a single way to see what we have documented about each thing.</p>
	  <p>This housekeeping also includes the google sheet, so everything is tidy enough to be useful and less a source of confusion.  This led me to think more about the purpose of the different things we have, and tweak things:
	  	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			  <li>website - the front door - the place to go to for design advice and everything about the design system (and the project work - hence this page)</li>
			  <li>collated documents - where what we know about each component/pattern is collated.  These are essentially the 'pages' of what we currently do, that are published here.  So needed to make each one 'the thing', by ensuring no orphan documents exist and that its all joined up.  These documents are the public advice, and can have comments, discussion, opinion - they are what we know and think.  Google docs are great to comment, track changes, collaborate etc - everyone can use with no technical training needed (unlike github).  So an important principle/need (note to self - add to my list &#128512;&#128512;) - minimise the barrier to entry/collaboration</li>
			  <li>Google sheet - use to track progress and see status - a view across the documentation - for example: whos working on documents, has it been reviewed.  The sheet contains more than this, like proposed patterns / ideas for patterns - they would be better surfaced on the site, with a mechanism for feedback and new patterns spotted (&#128513; another note to self)
		  	</li>
	  	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>wow, writing this weeknote is useful - made me think, and i added 4 useful items to the backlog/what we know - user needs, principles, something to test/learn more about, how we organise the work so its easier to do &#128541;</p>
